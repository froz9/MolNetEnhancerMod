# MolNetEnhancerMod
MolNetEnhancerMod is an alternative to the non-working MolNetEnhancer. It uses a modified approximation to retrieve SMILES classification, supporting both NPClassifier and ClassyFire for robust molecular networking and detailed structural insights in metabolomics data.


# For Map chemical class information using NPClassifier to mass spectral molecular networks
## To map chemical class information to a mass spectral molecular network, you need to:

- Create a molecular network using the [classical](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/quickstart/) or [feature-based](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking/) workflow through the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) platform
- Perform in silico structure annotation using Network Annotation Propagation (NAP), DEREPLICATOR, or another tool of preference for in silico structure annotation
Then execute the code in
